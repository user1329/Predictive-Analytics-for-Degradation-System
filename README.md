# **State-Space Modeling for Degrading Systems with Stochastic Neural Networks and Dynamic Bayesian Layers** 
**at IISE transactions**

This repo provides an approach to perform predictive analytics for degradation system with latent states. The provided jupyter notebook explains the steps for a hybrid simulated degradation dataset that can be simulated and used to train the model. This approach can be used to perform predictive analytics for degradation datasets like NASA CMAPSS dataset. 

The paper has already been accepted at IISE transactions and currently under process for online release.
