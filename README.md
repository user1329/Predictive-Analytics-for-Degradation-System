# Predictive-Analytics-for-Degradation-System

This repo provides an approach to perform predictive analytics for degradation system with latent states. The provided jupyter notebook explains the steps for a hybrid simulated degradation dataset that can be simulated and used to train the model. This approach can be used to perform predictive analytics for degradation datasets like NASA CMAPSS dataset.


This repository is based upon an article submitted for publication. The content of this repo will be finalised based on the final version of the paper, if accepted.
