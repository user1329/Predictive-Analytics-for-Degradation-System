# Predictive-Analytics-for-Degradation-System

This repo provides an approach to perform predictive analytics for degradation system with latent states. The provided jupyter notebokk explains the steps for a hybrid simulated degradation dataset that can be simulated and used to train the model. This approach can be used to perform predictive analytics for degradation datasets like NASA CMAPSS dataset.
